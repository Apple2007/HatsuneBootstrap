    <h2>August 31st, 2007 - March 9th, 2010: The Beginning of Hatsune Miku's Reign:</h2>
    <p>
        August 31st, 2007 would be a day all vocal synthesis fans and VOCALOID fans would come to remember, since on this day, the first version of Hatsune Miku's voice pack (the voice actor was Saki Fujita) was released by Crypton Future Media (I told you their name would be important). As soon as she was released, VOCALOID became a very popular piece of software, and it wasn't relegated to a niece product used by hobbyists or music producers. Music could now be made by anyone with some lyrics and some time on their hands to learn the software.

        Her blowup can be attributed to many factors, but the one that was the most impactful was her widespread reach through websites like YouTube and NicoNico Douga (basically Japan's version of YouTube, but not owned by Google), since they were starting to launch around the time Miku first launched on the market. These websites were breeding grounds for many different songs to start to appear. Here are some examples:

    <p class="text-center"><i><b>Fun Fact: "Nyanyanyanyanyanyanya!" by daniwellP would serve as the basis for the "Nyan Cat" meme! Yeah, it was Miku before Momo (who voiced in the Nyan Cat meme).</b></i></p>
    <p class="text-center"><i><b>Fun Fact (also): Tell Your World was actually commissioned by Google Chrome Japan for an ad they ran around 2011. We will get more into that though in the impact section.</b></i></p>
    <br>
    <p>Miku's success made Crypton respond by creating multiple other characters, such as the Kagamine Twins (Rin and Len), along with Megarine Luka, which would cap the Cryptonloids. All 6 are very popular even today (with Miku being the most popular of them all) and their music is still being made today as well. But, back in 2010, all of them became real when they started appearing in... concerts. Yeah, let's talk about holograms, illusions, and maybe even the Miku Expo 2024 drama.</p>

    <h2>March 9th, 2010 - Present: The Beginning of Hatsune Miku's *REAL* Reign:</h2>
    <p>
        On March 9th, 2010, Miku would appear in her first live concert where she was not a guest appearance. Now, you might be asking yourself: <b><i>HOW IS THAT EVEN DONE?! SHE'S NOT EVEN REAL!</i></b> Well, it's actually really simple:
    </p>
    <img class="center-block" src="mikuconcertdrawing.png" width="80%" height="80%">
    <h4 class="text-center">My terrible drawing...</h4>
    <p>
        This was how it was done up until Miku Expo 2024 (with <b>VERY</b> few exeptions). You had a projector in the back (the only brand I could think of is Epson, but I bet it's a different brand...) that would shine a video from a computer of some sort onto a piece of glass (or three pieces put together) to create a 3D hologram illusion. It worked, since these concerts (that were exclusive to Japan, at the time) sold out very quickly. Obviously, this was a <b><i>major success</i></b>!
        She would eventually end up in the US, starting with Mikunopolis at Anime Expo 2011 in Los Angeles. This was also a major success, and Miku Expo was born in 2014, and it has continuted on till the present day! <b><i>But, things have changed...</i></b>
    </p>

    <h2>The Miku Expo 2024 Drama (up-to-date to 4/10/2024):</h2>
    <p>I wanted to make a whole seperare section of the site dedicated to the Miku Expo 2024 drama. You might have seen it under the #MIKUEXPO2024 hashtag on Twitter/X, Threads, Instagram, etc., and you might have wondered what the hell happened. Well, time for an explanation...</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here are some of the problems happening with Miku Expo 2024, listed for your reading pleasure:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The LED Screen: When Miku Expo began in Vancouver, people started to notice that the usual projection tech (like I talked about above) wasn't there and it was replaced by an LED screen (basically a TV) that wasn't even intergrated into the surrounding stage set very well. It looked like a sore thumb/terrible. People were (and still are) angry about this change, and we still don't have an answer to why this happened.</li>
        <li>The Lack of Merch: One of the big appeals of going to Miku Expo is to buy merch and a lightstick to swing around during the show. For some reason, only 95 lightsticks were shipped to Portland and to San Jose, which is just stupid. Why would they do this? I have no idea, but they did.</li>
        <li>The Lack of Organization: So far, this only applies to San Jose, but the lines have been terrible, there is litterly no crowd control, and so much more. It seems like this may have been fixed though.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These things, plus more have caused people to start asking for refunds, looking into a class action lawsuit, and a petition with over 5,000 signatures to be created. We want answers Crypton and Crunchyroll.</p>
